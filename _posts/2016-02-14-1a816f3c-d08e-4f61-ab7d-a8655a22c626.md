What is worse than being trapped in Japan with a typhoon?  
Trapped during a public holiday weekend.

On our way from Kobe to Himeji, our train was delayed.  
It then moved a little, proceed to move slower, and finally our driver declared that we had to switch trains.  
Our initial plan was to have lunch in Himeji.  
When we checked into our hotel, it was time for dinner.

Chika booked a yakitori place for us and all I remember was trying chicken sashimi.  
As I took my first bite, there's this little corner in my mind, hoping that this chicken is so special that it will taste amazing uncooked.  
It tasted like raw chicken.

That night, I wandered out to a ramen joint nearby to wash the salmonella fear out of my mouth.  
But what do you know, the ramen joint specialises in chicken broth ramen.

The next morning, we made our way to Shosha-san.  
The direct translation is 'Calligraphy Mountain'.  
We had to bus, then take a cable car to get to one of the most historical temples in Japan.  
Unfortunately, its historical importance is not as important as the fact that 'The Last Samurai' was filmed there.  
That was highlighted bold everywhere, on brochures, pamphlets, tour guides.

We had oden for lunch.  
I was grumpy because the lady refused to break my 10000 yen.

We walked back to Himeji Castle.  
It had been under restoration for quite some time.  
That's why Chika and I never bothered to visit when we're in Kobe.

I came to Himeji thinking it would be a relaxing, historical town.  
But the public holiday weekend really proved its significance.

It was so crowded, that you'd imagine we are queuing up to see the Mona Lisa.  
I regretted not appreciating Shosha-san while I had the chance.

In fact, all we did, was simply queuing up to take really steep stairs to the top of the castle, then descend by the other really steep stairs to get out of the castle.  
It's like one of those present within a present within a present.  
All you get, in the end, was the experience of expecting something to happen.

The typhoon cancelled many trains.  
So we had to queue up again to purchase our shinkansen ticket to HIroshima.

On any other day, it would've been straight forward.  
But the typhoon, the crowd, and the heat just sucked the life out of us.

My first impression of Himeji is a very shallow one, filled with tourists.  
Hopefully I get to improve on that in the future.
